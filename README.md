## Thanks

Big thanks to the k8s@home team for their common library
and their workflows!

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add jr0dd https://jr0dd.github.io/charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo jr0dd` to see the charts.

## Support

These are just some of my personal charts I made to share with the public.
If you have an issue send a PR or open an issue.
