# cloudflare-ddns

This is a chart to use for Cloudflare DDNS.
All that is needed from you is your Zone API token
and your DNS API token (you have to manually create this).
Those will need to be encoded in base64 and added to templates/secrets.yaml

Thanks for the guys over at k8s@home for the common library!
